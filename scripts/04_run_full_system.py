"""
Taxes Reduce Savings: The tax on the young directly reduces their disposable income. 
For any given interest rate, both the "saver" and "borrower" types of agents have 
less money available. This leads to a decrease in their ability to save (or an 
increase in their need to borrow), which ultimately reduces the total supply of 
private savings available in the economy.

Less Capital for Firms: This decline in the supply of private savings means there 
are fewer funds available for the firm to borrow for investment. With a smaller 
pool of available capital, the firm invests less, leading to a smaller steady-state 
capital stock (K).

Diminishing Returns: According to the firm's production function, the marginal 
product of capital (MPK) is subject to diminishing returns. When the capital stock 
is high, the return on one extra unit of capital is low. Conversely, when the 
capital stock is low (as it is when taxes are high), the return on an additional 
unit of capital is high.

The Price Must Adjust: Since the equilibrium interest rate (r*) must equal the net 
marginal product of capital (MPK - Î´), a lower capital stock implies a higher MPK 
and therefore a higher equilibrium interest rate. Conversely, lower taxes lead to 
more savings, a larger capital stock, a lower MPK, and thus a lower equilibrium 
interest rate.
