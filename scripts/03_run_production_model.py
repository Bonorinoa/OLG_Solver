Understanding the Production Economy:
-----------------------------------
In our old pure exchange economy, the interest rate was just a price that balanced the desires of some people 
to save with the desires of others to borrow. It was a closed loop, and the equilibrium r* was relatively low 
because there was nothing particularly productive to do with the savings. In an economy with production, the 
long-run interest rate is determined not just by people's patience (beta) but by the underlying productivity 
of capital.

By adding the Firm, we ripped that closed loop open. We introduced a powerful new force: a productive 
investment opportunity.

New Demand for Savings: The firm enters the market as a massive new borrower. It doesn't borrow to smooth 
its consumption; it borrows to buy capital (K) and generate real output. This creates a huge new demand 
for the economy's savings.

The Price Must Rise: To meet this new, hungry demand for investment funds, the households in the economy 
must be convinced to save a lot more than they did before. The only way to incentivize this massive 
increase in savings is for the price of savings—the interest rate—to skyrocket.

Driven by Productivity: The equilibrium interest rate is now fundamentally tied to the marginal product 
of capital (MPK). The parameters we gave the firm (A=1.0, alpha=0.33) describe a very productive 
technology. The firm is willing to pay a very high interest rate because the return it gets from 
investing in an additional unit of capital is also very high. The equilibrium r* of 36.61\% reflects 
a world where the marginal return on investment is incredibly strong.
